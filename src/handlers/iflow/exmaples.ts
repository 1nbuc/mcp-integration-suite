The purpose of this IFLOW is to Replicate Product Inventory Information from SAP to 3rd party
This IFLOW takes an LOISTD from a SAP system as input
It then saves the application ID into the IDOC using a Content Modifier
The IDOC gets converted using a Message Mapping. The source structure is the IDOC
The Target structure is more of a placeholder for the acutal 3rd party system
After the mapping the XML gets converted into JSON using a standard module
Because there is one unneccesary root element left a groovy script removes this with the function processData
Afterwards another groovy script is running which fixes some JSON conversion issues
Then a content modifier wraps the whole message in an array
Before the request to the target system is made, a Request/Reply module is used to collect the response into a log
Then the request gets executed via HTTP using OAUTH2 Authentication and request method PUT
The response is then redirected by the Request/Reply module to a groovy script which logs the HTTP response

Filters and retrieves a list of campaigns from a Google Ads service account
The procedure is as follows:
initial trigger is a SOAP request to /com.sap.hybris.mkt.gaw.campaignServiceRead
First Step is a content modifier which sets some values from the configuration
It then sets central tenant address with groovy script
In addition it also sets API version with a script
It then parses some headers from the request
In the next step it calls a subprocess which I will describe now
It first builds the payload for the request and then gets the oAuth token by a subprocess (see if_google_get_oauth_token)
The last step is to call a processDirect adapter to trigger iflow if_fwd_google_request which sends the request
The request/reply module then returns the response
